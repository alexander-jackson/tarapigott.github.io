    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.3;" >As a recent 2021 Graduate of Global Sustainable Development from the University of Warwick, <i>an interdisciplinary degree that explores a multitude of global challenges</i>, I am motivated and excited to enter a career which works towards creating a more just and healthier world.  
        <p>I am especially interested in the <b>intersection of environmental elements of sustainability, with health</b>; such as health equality, sustainable healthcare and sustainable diets and food systems. This lead to me undertaking my undergraduate dissertation on exploring the inter-disciplinary perspectives on diet for advancing sustainable urban food policy. I therefore have in depth knowledge of routes for food policy improvement and understand the barriers to successful policy implementation at local through to national levels. 
        </p><p>Although I pride myself as a flexible, quick-learning, and multi-skilled individual, I believe my most significant skill set lies in communications. My <b>strong organisation, meticulous nature, design skills, and experience running online campaigns</b>, sets me up well to producing engaging and succinct communications. I would therefore excel at roles based in admin, internal or external communications, or campaign creation.
