    <h2>MY WORK</h2>
    <h3>Dissertation</h3>
    <p>Noticing the environmental and nutritional science <b>bias present in food policy</b> and the <b>tensions</b> present between different schools of thought on sustainable diet, I conducted research on how <b>cross-disciplinary perspectives</b> on sustainable diet are best translated into urban food policy by taking the form of a meta-narrative review. <p> The most significant findings show the need for a <b>joint food environment and behaviour change approach to food policy</b>, whilst tailoring interventions and messages to different groups within urban spaces.
        The review highlights the importance of future research on sustainable diet being reflexive and transdisciplinary, with a need for additional city-level specific research on how food policy be adapted to diverse locationally and culturally distinct contexts.</p><p> This meta-narrative review on sustainable diet is methodologically unparalleled and extends current thinking on sustainable diet by integrating the findings from many different schools of thought and reducing the tensions present between discourses.

    <h3>Stop Fuelling the Fire Campaign</h3>
    <p>Through my time on Christian Aid’s Young Activist Scheme, alongside other young activists, I launched the <b>Stop Fuelling The Fire</b> campaign which successfully led to the UK Government committing to stop funding overseas fossil fuel expansion. 
        To explore the work I did on this campaign, you can view the petition hosted on 38Degrees, which I set up and co-wrote. Through this platform, I also regularly emailed our signatories, updating them on the campaign and inspiring further action.  </p>

    <h3>Powerlifting Website</h3>
    <p>As a way of developing my programming and website design skills, I developed this website on Powerlifting (<i>a sport which I train and compete in</i>.) The website includes a ‘Good Lift Points’ calculator, a method of scoring in Powerlifting, which calculates the users points based on their inputted sex, bodyweight, squat, bench and deadlift. </p>
